# Team Blockbuster - Top Movies API

#### BU MET CS673 O1: Software Engineering, Fall 2024 - Team 6

## Project Description

Team Blockbuster is creating a microservice Data Science application which will provide the ability to query and display 
movie data based on various user inputs using the Kaggle IMDB Top 250 Movies dataset: 
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajugc/imdb-top-250-movies-dataset>

## Motivation

This application provides information for people who are curious about movie trends such as movies ratings across 
different countries, movie durations, or specific movie genres and categories, etc. This information can help people 
working in the film industry or similar industries in making important movie development choices.

## Framework

This microservice based application is built using a **Python Flask** framework where **ReactJS** will be used to create 
a frontend web-page where the user can input data points and **Python** will be used to manage backend operations that 
generate the movie data based on the input data received. **SQLite** will be used as the application's database. 

Overview:

- **Frontend:** ReactJS 
- **Backend:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite

## Tools Used

The following technologies will be used for our project:

- PyCharm Community (**2024.2.2**)
- GitHub Actions
- Python (**v3.12**)
- pip (**v24.2**)
    * Python Flask
    * PyLint
    * Pandas
- Docker (**v27.2.0**)
    * Docker Compose (**v2.29.2-desktop.2**)
- Podman (**5.2.2**)
- nodeJS (**v20.17.0**)
- SQLite (**v3**)

## How to Run Software

1. Open a command line console and clone the main branch of this repository (SSH approach) in location of choice using 
   the command below:

    `git clone git@github.com:BUMETCS673/seprojects-cs673olf24team6.git`

    Note: SSH approach was used for the command above. Please follow the appropriate GitHub guidelines to set up SSH 
    keys before cloning this repository.

2. Using either file manager or a terminal window navigate to the code directory.

3. To run this application the services must be started in the correct order or an error may occur. The first service to 
   start is Python Flask
   - `cd backend` or navigate to backend directory
   - To run the application using Python use `python3 backend.py`
   - To run the application using Docker or Podman run the commands below
     - docker build -t flask_backend .
     - docker run -p 5000:5000 -t flask_backend
   
4. To Run the frontend application you need be in the /code/frontend directory.
     - To run the application using Node use `npm start`
     - To run the application using Docker or Podman run the commands below
       - docker build -t node-frontend .
       - docker run -p 3000:3000 -t node-frontend

5. At this stage in the project you will need to allow a web-browser to open or open web-browser and navigate to 
   localhost:3000 where you will be able to view the frontend application 

## How to Run Tests

### Backend
1. From backend directory
2. Podman/Docker build -t flask_backend .
3. Podman/Docker run -idt --name flask_backend flask_backend
4. Podman/Docker exec -it flask_backend /bin/bash
5. `cd tests`
6. `pytest process_query_request_test.py`
